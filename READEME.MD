# CSI-Secret-Injector
A Mutating Admission Webhook Controller for injecting secrets created by secret-store csi driver into Pods.
Requires the Secret-Store CSI Driver as well as a secret-provider to actually do anything useful.

Created for my personal use, mostly as a learning experience. Probably not very useful for anyone else.

See manifests/ for example configuration.
